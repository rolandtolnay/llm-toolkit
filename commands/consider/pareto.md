<objective>
Apply Pareto's principle to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Identify the vital few factors that drive the majority of results.
</objective>

<process>
1. Identify all factors, options, tasks, or considerations in scope
2. Estimate relative impact of each factor on the desired outcome
3. Rank by impact (highest to lowest)
4. Identify the cutoff where a small minority of factors account for the majority of impact
5. Present the vital few with specific, actionable recommendations
6. Note what can be deprioritized or ignored
</process>

<output_format>
**Vital Few (focus here):**
- Factor 1: [why it matters, specific action]
- Factor 2: [why it matters, specific action]
- Factor 3: [why it matters, specific action]

**Trivial Many (deprioritize):**
- Brief list of what can be deferred or ignored

**Bottom Line:**
Single sentence on where to focus effort for maximum results.
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Specific, actionable recommendations for each vital factor
- Clearly separates high-impact from low-impact factors
- Explains why each vital factor matters
- Gives clear direction on what to ignore or defer
