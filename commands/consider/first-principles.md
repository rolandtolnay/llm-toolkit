description: Break down to fundamentals and rebuild from base truths
argument-hint: [problem or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply first principles thinking to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided). Strip away assumptions, conventions, and analogies to identify fundamental truths, then rebuild from scratch.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the problem or belief being examined
2. List all current assumptions (even "obvious" ones)
3. Challenge each assumption: "Is this actually true? Why?"
4. Identify base truths that cannot be reduced further
5. Rebuild solution from only these fundamentals
</process>

<output_format>
**Current Assumptions:**
- Assumption 1 — **holds** / **breaks** / **partially holds**: [why]
- Assumption 2 — **holds** / **breaks** / **partially holds**: [why]

**Fundamental Truths:**
- Truth 1: [why this is irreducible]
- Truth 2: [why this is irreducible]

**Rebuilt Understanding:**
[Conclusions built from only the fundamental truths]

**New Possibilities:**
[Options that emerge when broken assumptions are removed]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Surfaces hidden assumptions
- Distinguishes convention from necessity
- Identifies irreducible base truths
- Opens new solution paths not visible before
- Avoids reasoning by analogy ("X worked for Y so...")
</success_criteria>
