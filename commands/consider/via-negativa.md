description: Improve by removing rather than adding
argument-hint: [situation or leave blank for current context]
---

<objective>
Apply via negativa to $ARGUMENTS (or the current discussion if no arguments provided).

Instead of asking "What should I add?", ask "What should I remove?"
</objective>

<process>
1. State the current situation or goal
2. List everything currently present (activities, features, commitments, beliefs)
3. For each item, ask: "Does removing this improve the outcome?"
4. Identify what to stop, eliminate, or say no to
5. Describe the improved state after subtraction
</process>

<output_format>
**Current State:**
[What exists now - activities, features, commitments]

**Subtraction Candidates:**
- [Item]: Remove because [reason] → Impact: [what improves]
- [Item]: Remove because [reason] → Impact: [what improves]
- [Item]: Remove because [reason] → Impact: [what improves]

**Keep (Passed the Test):**
- [Item]: Keep because [genuine value]

**After Subtraction:**
[Description of leaner, better state]

**What to Say No To:**
[Future additions to reject]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Each subtraction candidate cites a specific cost (maintenance, complexity, attention)
- Removals don't break core function — distinguish load-bearing from dead weight
- Keep items survived genuine challenge, not just familiarity bias
- Subtraction candidates outnumber keep items (bias toward removal)
</success_criteria>
